# Docker ignore file
# 
# The goal here is to ignore everything in the test/ directory
#  to prevent rebuilding the development image unless package.xml
#  files have changed. This is somewhat hacky, due to the following
#  issue:
# https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30018
#
# Specifically, this means that we'll need to rebuild if extensionless
#  files in the test/ directory are modified, or if directories themselves
#  are created or deleted. Still, better than nothing.

# ignore everything that has an extension (theoretically all non-directories)
test/**/*.*

# also completely ignore build spaces
test/devel
test/build
test/install
test/logs

# allow all package.xml files for rosdep
!test/**/package.xml
